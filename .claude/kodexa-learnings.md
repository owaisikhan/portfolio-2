- **Said / saw:** "Before you render the design, before you develop it, first show me the possible concepts. Tell me what design language you're going to use and what design system you're going to use. First create a skeleton and show it to me. We'll agree on the skeleton first, then we'll go ahead and create the actual design." and "First, we'll finalize one page."
- **Context:** portfolio-2 redesign request (new projects, hero video, project media)
- **Lesson:** For a redesign or new site, the first deliverable is 2 to 3 named concepts (palette, type pairing, one-line rationale each), the design system plan, and a greyscale skeleton of one page. No visual design or code until the user agrees the skeleton; then finish one page before starting the next.
- **Scope:** all projects
- **Target in skill:** references/types/marketing-site.md, section 8 "Redesigns and variants"

### L-002 · 2026-10-01 · medium · gap
- **Said / saw:** "for each project shipped also add an image on the home page and in the detail page add a walk through video of the site/product and suggest improvements too"
- **Context:** portfolio-2, project data model
- **Lesson:** Portfolio project entries need a cover image (home grid) and a walkthrough video with chapters (case study), plus a "what I would improve next" list. Plan the data fields (`cover`, `walkthrough`, `improvements`) at skeleton stage so the layout reserves space for them.
- **Scope:** type: marketing-site (portfolios)
- **Target in skill:** references/types/marketing-site.md, section 7 "Content, pages and SEO"
- **Status:** logged

### L-003 · 2026-10-01 · medium · choice
- **Said / saw:** "remove this project" (artifact comment on the Meridian Digital Consulting row of the skeleton's work index)
- **Context:** portfolio v3 skeleton, project list
- **Lesson:** Meridian Digital Consulting is not shown on this portfolio. Remove its entry from `app/_data/projects.js` in the v3 build and record it as "out, owner's call" in that file's header ledger.
- **Scope:** project
- **Target in skill:** none (project content)
- **Status:** project

### L-004 · 2026-10-01 · strong · choice
- **Said / saw:** "go with this design and build" (artifact comment on "B · Cutting Room"; A "Day Book" was marked Recommended)
- **Context:** portfolio v3 concepts: A light ledger, B dark film-led edit suite, C reskin of v2
- **Lesson:** For this owner's own portfolio, a media-first dark direction beat the light editorial one even when the work is mostly business software. When the brief includes a hero video and per-project walkthroughs, offer a media-first concept and do not assume light wins because the clients are small businesses.
- **Scope:** type: marketing-site (portfolios)
- **Target in skill:** references/types/marketing-site.md, section 3 "Design direction"
- **Status:** logged

### L-005 · 2026-10-01 · strong · rule
- **Said / saw:** "go with this design and build", in reply to a skeleton that listed "stage 2: home page visual design" before the build
- **Context:** portfolio v3 planning sheet
- **Lesson:** The concept and skeleton round is the approval gate. Once the owner picks a direction on it, build the page directly in that direction rather than producing a separate static design round; iterate on the built page with screenshots.
- **Scope:** all projects
- **Target in skill:** references/types/marketing-site.md, section 8 "Redesigns and variants" (refines L-001)
- **Status:** logged

### L-006 · 2026-10-01 · medium · rule
- **Said / saw:** "ask me if any project database is paused or you need .env.local to access the site, i will send it,, even the login details for this screen capture purpose"
- **Context:** capturing covers and walkthroughs for 16 projects, most behind Supabase sign-in
- **Lesson:** Before capturing screenshots or walkthroughs of apps behind a login, check database status (Supabase list_projects) and ask the owner in one message for the exact demo logins or env files needed, per project. Prefer a demo account with sample data; never commit credentials.
- **Scope:** all projects
