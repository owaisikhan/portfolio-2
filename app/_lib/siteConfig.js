  about: [
    "Most of what I build is not a landing page. It is software that has to be right on a Tuesday afternoon while someone counts cash, reconciles stock or bills a shop on credit. So I care more about the boring parts than the pretty ones: data that cannot go wrong, what happens when the network drops, and a screen the person at the counter can use without training.",
    "I work mostly in Next.js with React and Postgres, and package products for Windows with Electron or for Android with Expo when a business needs to own its software rather than rent it. When a project calls for AI, I keep it grounded: read-only database roles, retrieval over real documents, and answers that say so when they do not know.",

    {
      q: "Do you work alone or with a team?",
      a: "Both. Most of the work here is built as a two-person team: we take a project from an empty repository to a shipped product together, splitting the build rather than passing tickets back and forth. Some, like Folio and this site, I built on my own.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can you build something that runs without the internet?",
      a: "Yes, and I have shipped three. The Offline Petrol Pump Manager installs like a normal Windows program with its own database inside. Sohana POS runs a wholesaler's billing on one Android phone. The Committee Manager does both.",

    {
      q: "How do you handle AI features safely?",
      a: "The security boundary is never the prompt. Model-written SQL runs through a database role that can only read the catalogue tables, behind a guard that rejects anything but a single read-only query. Orders, addresses and profiles stay out of reach whatever the model writes.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does a project usually start with?",
      a: "A call about the numbers the business already tracks by hand, then a short written scope with a first slice we can ship and react to. I would rather correct direction in week one than in month three.",

      q: "What's your stack, and can you work in mine?",
      a: "My default is Next.js with React, Tailwind and Postgres or Supabase, packaged with Electron or Expo when it needs to run on the device. I have also shipped in Vite, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Query and Python with FastAPI, so an existing codebase is not a problem.",
