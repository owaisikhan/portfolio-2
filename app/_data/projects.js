 *
 * Fields added for v3:
 *   category     one of the keys in `categories` below; drives the index filter
 *   platform     short, visitor-facing ("Windows", "Web", "Android")
 *   featured     true puts the project in the six spreads at the top of Work
 *   worksOffline true when the product runs with no internet at all
 *   cover        { src, alt } under /public/work, or null for the slate fallback
 *   walkthrough  { src, poster, duration, chapters: [{ at, label }] } or null
 *   improvements what we would build next; shown on the case study
 *
 * `isPrivate: true` means the source lives in a private client repository.
 * Those entries carry no repo link on purpose: a client clicking through to
 * a 404 looks worse than no link at all.
